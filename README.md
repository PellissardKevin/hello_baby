### DESCRIPTION

<span style="color:black">Pregnancy is a stressful, confusing time, with lots of questions.
Parents-to-be need reassurance to ensure that their pregnancy goes as smoothly as possible, and that their baby develops properly.
To do this, they can follow the progress of the pregnancy, find answers to certain questions. And then follow the progress of their child(ren).</span>

### THE ENVIRONMENT
<span style="color:black">We use the Python language with the Kivy and Django frameworks.
Python is a higher-level language, more flexible and easier to learn. It also enables object-oriented programming.
Django is a micro framework that we use as a backend to manage MySQL queries and database management.
Kivy is a framework, useful for creating cross-platform touch applications with a natural user interface. An intermediate language (Kv), to easily build custom widgets.</span>
